# Test Cases for Holberton Simple Shells

To run the tests, execute the name of the test case you want followed by the command you would use to run your shell executable. For example, `./task0.1 ./hsh`

Each test case script starts with a shebang, the line `source test.sh`, then a number of lines starting with `runtest` followed by the command(s) you want the shell to try running. See `sample.sh` for an example.
