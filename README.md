# Test Cases for Holberton Simple Shells

To run the tests, execute the name of the test case you want followed by the command you would use to run your shell executable. For example, `./sample.sh ./hsh`

Each test case script starts with a shebang, the line `source test.sh`, then a number of lines starting with `runtest` followed by the command(s) you want the shell to try running. See `sample.sh` for an example.

# To contribute
### Creating a new test file
Create a new file named the task you are testing for. Like: `5_args.sh` . Follow this naming convention: 
task number_purpose_of_task.sh

So if you were writing a test for advanced task 9. Simple shell 0.4.1. The name of the file you create would be:
`9_exit.sh`

Make sure you make your file an executable before uploading it :)

### Writing the tests

Follow the format in the [wiki](https://github.com/HermesBoots/simple_shell_tests/wiki/Writing-the-tests)
